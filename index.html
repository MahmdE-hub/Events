      <p> Statistically speaking with numbers of immigrants coming to America, we can say that many of them came to America to work and earn money. But, many of them don't know the rights they have. We are speaking about 14% percent of America populations don't know their rights and this is a major problem as they face many discrimination and injustice by others living in America. And espically with the increase number of immigrantions in America, this will most likely increase the discrimination and injustice that they have to living in America.

 Many of the immigrants don't stand up for themselves because they believe that they have less rights than American Citizens. However, this is not true. The constitution states that "the U.S. Constitution protects persons regardless of their immigration status. Key protections include the prohibition against law enforcement conducting unreasonable searches and seizures; or violating the constitutional guarantee of due process; or engaging in discrimination based on race or ethnicity". With this and the first amendment rights as well. So, to the people that believe that they have less rights than American Citizens, they can stand up for themselves and stand up for the rights that they have the same rights and freedom that are given to citizens.

We can take action by donating to the immigrant rights funding. We can also take action by educating ourselves and others about the rights that we have. We can also take action by signing petitions and donating to the immigrant rights funding. People that face discrimination can protest to raise awareness to the problem. As well as immigrants or anyone that faces discrimination or injustice they have to report it to limit these type of actions. After all we are all humans, there is no differences between anyone because of the social status, race, religion, culture, etc. So, we can all stand up for ourselves and others. And always remeber that you are eqaul to everyone and we should help and care about each other.
